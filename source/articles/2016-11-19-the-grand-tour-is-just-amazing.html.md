<p>Yesterday I watched The Grand Tour and I was excited about it. The boys I love (no homo here) from the old Top Gear are back. The friendship, the jokes, the excitement, the cars, and all the memories from the old TG are coming back again and I must say I was really enjoyed<br />
in their first episode</p>
<p>especially the “Celebrity Brain Crash” segment where celebrities were supposed to be in the show but ends up getting bitten by a snake, got failed in sky diving, and got suddenly died. <b>It’s Top Gear to a whole new level.</b></p>

<p>I think the pilot episode of the TGT should end the debate between the new TG and this one ‘cause it is very very very different in each other. TG trying to be Fifth Gear. And TGT continuing what they did in the old TG. Period.</p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, Amazon are now slowly earning money and BBC executives were regretting because of this lol.</b></p>
