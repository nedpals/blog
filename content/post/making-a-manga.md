I love reading Manga. It has a variety of genres to choose from and even though it is weird to read from right to left you'll never disagree with the art that has an impressive level of detail. Manga is one of those miracles Japanese people created after they've been nuked twice. However, I will not be talking particularly about that topic.

Last two weeks ago, I decided not to join the film project for our Arts subject and instead create a manga with more than five pages and no restrictions (i guess). You may think that I'm gonna be making a hentai in the first place but nope I suck at drawing dicks and _vagenes_ so it's kinda weird to make. Anyway, here's my experience and the process I did in order to make a short homemade manga.

\### Not so much fun info

The term \*\*manga\*\* is a comic created in Japan so  technically I'm only creating a comic since I ain't Japanese. But the fact that most of the elements were taken from the Japanese way, it is best and well suited to call it \*\*manga\*\* instead.

Okay, back to studio.

\## Story Brainstorming

This is a tricky part. I never like to create an original one. If I we're to create one, they we're more shittier than those wattpad fiction stories about their favorite gay couples. At my first week, I decided to use the script of our animation project. Everyone in the group would call me as "unoriginal" so I didn't care about it but then I realized that a three week deadline with a story like this will not be finished on time so I devised a new story based on it. 

The story I did was short and it was a prequel to the animation script with everything is brand new except for the protagonist. Technically it's a whole new "different" story so here's the plot goes:

> The story of how Arth (the main protagonist) got into the world of gaming with the guidance of his father who is a professional gamer.

Thats not exactly the plot but it was pretty much it. And when the all the parts of a story such as the characters and setting have been set, it's time to create a dialogue.

Creating a dialogue is not difficult to make if you have already the flow of the story and also read several chapters of a manga. Thanks to my pure boredom, the script/dialogue of the whole story was finished in just two hours and was estimated to have 10-12 pages. That's enough already and we can now proceed in creating the art.

\## Finding a House (Setting)

So the story takes place in a house but not really just an ordinary house since the family is let's say financially stable but not kinda rich. So I decided to use the wonderful Pinterest app to find 3d model house designs that can be our perfect candidate for the manga's setting. I found one that's balanced and at the same time has a floor plan so it's definitely a plus when it comes in the accuracy of the place in the manga.

\## Panels

I used Krita, an open source painting software in creating my manga that's great and easy to use.
