<p>The <a href="https://oneplus.net/3t">OnePlus 3T</a> was announced yesterday and at first I was like…</p>
<blockquote><p>
Holy shit the newly revamped phone was amazing!</p></blockquote>
<p>It was really another awesome thing made by OnePlus. An additional 40 dollar phone with better CPU, camera, battery, and software but it made the launch controversial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it became “controversial” because OnePlus was releasing the phone early months after they launched the OnePlus 3. As a OnePlus fan even though I haven’t own any of their phones yet, I was a bit disappointed on that one because of it but then I came across this article from <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/exclusive-the-philosophy-behind-the-op3t-why-oneplus-released-this-device-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-your-oneplus-3/">XDA</a> as to why the phone was released by the company early.</p>
<blockquote><p><i></i></p>
<p><i><br />
</i><i>According to OnePlus, the 3T was devised after the launch of the OnePlus 3, and it was a decision made in part because of the intricacies of the company’s business model of limited supply and also because they had continuously worked on advancing the hardware, and they felt that they could implement these improvements into a new device and optimize their line-up.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>For me, they should haven’t release this today but instead in the next year as OnePlus 4 as a lot of its users will be pissed off and the OnePlus 3 is a great phone for 2016 already. It is <b>more than enough </b>of what a smartphone should be in 2016 and it has satisfied a lot of its users. But as long as the software updates are being continued, owners shouldn’t be worried about that and that’s one great thing about OnePlus until now: <b>they never settle</b>.</p>
<p>Oh well, another new lesson for OnePlus.</p>
