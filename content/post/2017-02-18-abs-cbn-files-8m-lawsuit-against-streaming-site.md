<p>I have known <a href="http://kissasian.com">KissAsian</a> as one of the many resilient sites that offer pretty good streaming to Korean/Asian dramas for free and also a more known sister site of <a href="http://kissanime.ru">KissAnime</a>. Yesterday as I have read the news, it’s pretty much the Philippine network is up to the “copyright infringement money” in order to feed their “high quality” artists rather than letting shows getting pirated and get more attention from viewers around the world. This is bullshit. Like, wheres the logic here? Suing sites then get settled with enormous money doesn’t last forever okay?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I were the CEO of it, I’ll let the pirated site go as long as they share atleast a bit of their ad revenue. Also, with it, more viewers around the world will watch not just overseas Filipinos. With more fans, more networks are getting the rights of the show and that means more money and the cycle goes on. But I bet it’s pretty hard to do that since the word “pirate” has been an evil word in the media corporate world since its inception or the boom of pirated VHS whatsoever.</p>
