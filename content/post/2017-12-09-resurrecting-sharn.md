Last August I decided to gave up developing [my first ever open source tool](https://thisis.nedpals.xyz/2017/08/i-broke-sharn/) written on Crystal. I stopped it due to a bug caused in my inefficient system in detecting repos and also lack of motivation to continue the project. I'm a sort of lazy programmer that just codes whenever I'm bored and were mostly half-baked or not completed due lack of goals to complete. But it kinda sucks actually since it's my first ever contribution to a language that's very young and it continues to evolve.

I immediately regretted this and was hesitated if I should go back again or not until I received a notification.
