Media and Information Literacy or commonly known as MIL is one of the basic subjects you'll get when you reach Grade 11 as part of the K-12 curriculum in order for students to be trained and be disciplined in using not just the social media but also other forms of traditional media such as broadcast and print. But why should we give importance to this subject?

In the modern era, the way society turns events has becoming more and more powerful in just a click of a button. On what it takes years to have a revolution back in the old days can be easily done again within just hours due to the widespread usage of new forms of media such as the internet. It may seemingly a good thing but behind it are the destructive negative effects it holds. Those negative effects are really really scary. It might misinform the people leading to a crisis, might tricked you, or even worse, might divide the nation that once been peaceful. That's why knowing how to use and consume media properly and responsibly is one of the key effective ways in order for you to know the real story without damaging being a citizen of the country.
