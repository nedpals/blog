It truly saddens me that [Batoto](http://bato.to) will now be shutting down. Even though I don't regularly visit their site anymore, it became my alternative destination when it comes to english-translated manga whereas mainstream mangasites can't. 

I remembered the first time I visited it, I was shocked by it's wide catalog of mangas from various different scanlation groups. The scanlations there where pretty good which something I am proud. But the only thing I was disappointed with is that they're not mobile friendly at all which led me to download an app (I forgot what it is called) that I can use comfortably. Nonetheless, It was one of the greatest manga sites i've ever been. 

It's very hard to manage the site actually. Considering the amount of problems everyday (bots, DDoS, etc.) it sure is a never-ending stress and I understand that. I think it would have been great if it being archived instead using [IPFS](https://ipfs.org) so that it would never have to been shut down. Truly, Bato.to is a great site and the users of it will never forget it's contribution to the weeabooism/otaku fandom.

So long, my friend.
