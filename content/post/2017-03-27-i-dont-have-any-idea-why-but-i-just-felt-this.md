<p>I donâ€™t have any idea why but I just felt this game is super oddly satisfying for me. You know the gravity, the physics, and etc. Itâ€™s excites me at the same time satisfying to my eyes. Just I dunno why.</p>
<p>And second, why is Ketchapp publishing so many good games at all? Like wth you take my boredom away. Go away guys. ðŸ˜‚</p>
