Right now, I'm using Ubuntu as my daily driver for my laptop which happens to be its fifth year today since I bought it. Everything's really really fine including casual browsing except when I entered Google Drive. GDrive is very unresponsive as hell making my laptop unusable for a minute and a half. When you do something in there, it will take you another five seconds to complete or to just move. Also the app loads in just two minutes under a 900kbps connection. **Seriously, this is very annoying as hell.**

## Dear Google...

**Dear Google,** your current interface for Drive is a data and performance mess. I liked your interface back when you introduced this product. Why not put a basic version for it just like what you did to [Maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3031966?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)? Online file drives are also important too, duh.

## Why not build your own?

If you suggest I should build my own instead or used those ones found in GitHub, then I would say no. No because it's a waste of time to develop and a headache to maintain due to rate limits, bug, and etc. The API's are a bit too complex for me to put into a simple application. Also, this so called "**third world**" problem shouldn't be big deal to me because I don't really much use it everyday and the network is pretty slow so I cannot rely to put big files there so I just use it for photo backups whatsoever.
