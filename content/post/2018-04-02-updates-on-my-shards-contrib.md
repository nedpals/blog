Holy shit. Finally I'm back again after a completing my junior high and it's been a tiring week for me. Tonight I have something to share that makes me curse a lot especially as a first time contributor.

Last month I have [announced](https://thisis.nedpals.xyz/2018/02/sharn-0.2.0/) that I will be integrating Sharn's features into the Shards dependency manager by the end of March as I have promised. I was really hyped back then but turns out that it was the opposite and stalled the development of this feature when somebody from the Crystal team just against with it (either with the design decisions of the feature or the feature itself).

[Julien Portalier](https://github.com/ysbaddaden), a Crystal language dev, at the [beginning](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards/issues/144#issuecomment-345503868) was really against with it and his reason was that he wasn't able to find a "proposal with a proper solution" in it and it sounds bullshit to me. Back then, I created Sharn as a demonstrate my propsed solution for it and I was working hard in effort to get noticed
