I occasionally watch Korean drama but when I do have time, I usually watch them including the credits where it was great and make me satisfied of what I watched.\
One of the most common thing's I've found in a typical modern-day Korean drama is that:\
- the OST of the dram\
- fades/dips to white\
- pulse effect\
- FREEZE FRAME moments from the current episode with glowing effects and cinematic zoom\
- bokeh thing\
- and of course sponsors/ads in rectangles\
\
I thought this would be really easy to remake it using a video editor, some clips, and a handful of free green screen footage from YouTube.\
