<p>If you‚Äôre planning to buy a mobile VR headset like the Google Cardboard, consider first these if your phone supports:</p> <p>1. High resolution support - a good VR experience should have atleast 1080p resolution support. Most mid to high-range smartphones have this supported so ignore this one if your phone supports it.</p> <p>2. Gyroscope - out of all the sensors that requires to play VR videos inside that smart brick, gyroscope is the most crucial yet important sensor of your phone if you want to use it in VR as it detects motion and directions of your head in order to have a real virtual reality experience.</p> <p>3. Google Cardboard - It might be optional but this app doesn‚Äôt just let you watch 360 videos on your headset but it also enables you to adjust your viewfinder or anything related in adjusting your VR experience on your phone.<br /> If your phone have all of these, then you‚Äôre good to go.</p> <p>Also for those who are saying that this isn‚Äôt worth to buy for because it doesn‚Äôt work or you have poor experience in it please check again the list above. I bought it ahead of time and the only phone that atleast supports (except no gyro) is Asus Zenfone 3 Max. Although it had a poor experience in it, for me it doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as you feel the ‚Äúreality‚Äù in virtual reality.</p> <p>Side note: I‚Äôm looking forward to buy a Nokia 3 smartphone which all of those things I mentioned above have in it so yeah hihihi üòÅüòÅ</p>
